# JavaScript-Methods
Assignment 2

GOAL
To improve your understanding of JavaScript syntax, functions, and higher-order functions, in additional to a better understanding of JavaScript and Array methods.
ASSIGNMENT
Consider the following native JavaScript methods:
map()
filter()
some()
every()
reduce()
includes()
indexOf()
lastIndexOf()
Object.keys()
Object.values()

In this assignment, you will re-create these methods using JavaScript functions. For example, you will create your own "myMap" method corresponding to the native "map" method (see list below).
Make sure to carefully understand what each native method is designed to do, and DO NOT use any of the respective native JavaScript methods to implement your solutions. However, if applicable, you can re-use your own methods after you have created them. 
Strongly suggested: Use Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs linked above to understand how each native JavaScript method works. Pay attention to what arguments they take as well as the return value.  

Implement your solutions for the following JavaScript methods:
map()
Without using the native "Array.prototype.map" method of JavaScript, compose a function titled "myMap" that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements. Syntax: myMap(callbackFn)
filter()
Without using the native “Array.prototype.filter” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled "myFilter" that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements. Syntax: myFilter(callbackFn)
some() 
Without using the native "Array.prototype.some" method of JavaScript, compose a function titled "mySome" that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements. Syntax: mySome(callbackFn)
every()
Without using the native “Array.prototype.every” method of JavaScript, compose a function titled "myEvery" that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements. Syntax: myEvery(callbackFn)
reduce()
Without using the native "Array.prototype.reduce" method of JavaScript, compose a function titled "myReduce" that will take in an array of elements and execute a callback function on each of those elements. Syntax: myReduce(callbackFn)
includes()
Without using the native "Array.prototype.includes" method of JavaScript, compose a function titled "myIncludes" that will take in an array of elements and indicate whether or not a target element is contained within the input array. This returns a boolean. Syntax: myIncludes(searchElement)
indexOf()
Without using the native "Array.prototype.indexOf" method of JavaScript, compose a function titled "myIndexOf" that will take in an array of elements and returns the index of the first encounter of a target element (if it is found) or -1 if that element does not exist within the input array. Syntax: myIndexOf(searchElement)
lastIndexOf()
Without using the native "Array.prototype.lastIndexOf" method of JavaScript, compose a function titled "myLastIndexOf" that will take in an array of elements and returns the index of the last encounter of a target element (if it is found) or -1 if that element does not exist within the input array. Syntax: myLastIndexOf(searchElement)
Object.keys()
Without using the native "Object.keys" method of JavaScript, compose a function titled " Object.myKeys" that will take in an object and return all of the keys of the key:value pairs of that object. Syntax: Object.myKeys(object)
Object.values()
Without using the native "Object.values" method of JavaScript, compose a function titled " Object.myValues" that will take in an object and return all of the values of the key:value pairs of that object. Syntax: Object.myValues(object)
